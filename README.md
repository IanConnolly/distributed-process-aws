### distributed-process-aws

AWS EC2 backend for [Cloud Haskell](http://haskell-distributed.github.com)

Exposes roughly the same API as
[the Azure backend](https://github.com/haskell-distributed/distributed-process-azure).

Also exposes a number of new primitives that allow for the run-time creation of
new CloudServices and VirtualMachines and the scaling of said CloudServices.
